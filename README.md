## Project Overview

The **Student Grade Manager** is a C++ application designed to manage and analyze student records. It allows users to input student details, assign grades for various subjects, calculate averages, and save the data to a file. The program demonstrates key programming concepts such as dynamic memory management, object-oriented design, and file handling.

## Features

1. **Add Student**  
   Input a student's name and grades for four predefined subjects: Math, Science, Literature, and History. The program generates a unique random ID for each student and calculates their average grade.

2. **Display All Students**  
   View a neatly formatted table showing the ID, name, and average grade of all students.

3. **Calculate Subject Average**  
   Compute the overall average grade for a specific subject across all students.

4. **Save to File**  
   Save all student records to a binary file for persistent storage.

5. **Exit**  
   Exit the program safely after performing operations.
